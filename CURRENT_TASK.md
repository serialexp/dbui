# Current Tasks

## Database Objects to Add Per Schema/Database

### High Priority
- [ ] Functions/Stored Procedures - Very common, especially in PostgreSQL and MySQL
- [ ] Materialized Views - PostgreSQL specific, but widely used for performance

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Sequences - PostgreSQL has these (auto-increment generators)
- [ ] Triggers - Useful to see what automation exists on tables

### Lower Priority
- [ ] Custom Types/Domains - PostgreSQL specific
- [ ] Extensions - PostgreSQL specific (like PostGIS)

## Notes
- Start with Functions and Materialized Views (PostgreSQL only) as they're most commonly needed
- Functions especially are heavily used in many PostgreSQL databases
